## Intro
This tool will provide you a way to subscribe to students' class schedules on your calendar on PCs, mailboxes or iCloud devices. Thereby you can easily across forthcoming classes, including professor, classroom and exact time.

Also, subscribing to a calendar means classes can be auto-updated. You will never bother with semester changes or temporary class adjustments as long as they are updated by the academic affairs office.

As an inadvertent advantage, students can subscribe to multiple class tables with one device, therefore you can add your intimate's schedule simultaneously and compare leisures straightforward.

## Under the hood
This tool will simply return an iCalendar file which contains all your class schedules over the semester.
Your calendar provider will re-download this iCalendar file periodically in order to provide you an updated schedule.
